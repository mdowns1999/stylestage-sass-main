# Overview

This project was a team project. The purpose of this project was to receive a web page and style it without touching the HTML. This would force each of us to exercise our skills of using various CSS selectors and use our creativity to get the web page to look how we wanted it. We were also not allowed to use any JavaScript according to the rules the creator of web page made. I specifically made the header, footer and nav bar of the page. I also made the bottom part of the page with the three cards and the various buttons around it. Other parts of the page were made by my teammates.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to program all my HTML and SASS/CSS.  I also used GitHub Pages to host my web page.
